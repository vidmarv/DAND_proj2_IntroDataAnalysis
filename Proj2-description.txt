# Project 2 for DAND

## Overview and notes:
The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. 
The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy 
firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer 
does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. 
The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.

The NICS data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of 
firearm checks by month, state, and type.
The U.S. census data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables 
at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (2016), 
but a few have data for more than one year.


## Questions:

What census data is most associated with high gun per capita? 
Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations? 
What is the overall trend of gun purchases?
